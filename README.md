# iCar

Created an "Intelligent Car" that would be able to follow a black line on its own without assistance.

This was created with:
* An Arduino Uno as the brains of the project
* 2 gear motors to move the car
* Light sensors to detect where there is a black line or solid white
* A portable battery pack in order to make the car wireless
* In the code we also implemented a callibration system. That ways the values are updated each run
